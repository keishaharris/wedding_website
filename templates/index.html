            <p>
              I made up my mind: it was 2019 and I should be getting settled for realü§© So, a conversation ensued between a friend and I about ‚Äú wife material‚Äù - a responsible enough lady that could become someone‚Äôs wifeü§© He talked about a good looking girl in his Parish that could be a good match. I wasn‚Äôt too impressed about churchy folks that feigned spirituality but lacked Christian Virtues but I needed to give it a trial. Yes, I got a good one, a blend of Spirituality and moderate Socials; she‚Äôs forthright and outspoken with a perpetual charming smile on her face. I got her Instagram handle and we vibed easily. We chatted back and forth until we got comfortable enough to make phone calls. Few minutes call couldn‚Äôt do the job so we did lots of minutes and hours until we wanted more- to see each other in person. I was in Eastern Europe so we decided to see each other a couple of times; we fashioned out every possible way to bond and advance the relationship. 
              The love got better and stronger. We did all love could permit but we wanted more. Love doesn‚Äôt know enough it seems... I stayed up most nights to converse with Ebun due to the time difference between us.
              We texted and even exchanged emails! We wrote love notes and I bought her flowers every time we got together again. We did the Netflix Party thing to unwind times we got worked up. She just cared and I couldn‚Äôt careless! 
              We relished sumptuous delicacies at restaurants and even went to the Zooü§©We became true friends but not without our differences; we argued  but made progress, we continue to work on ourselves.
              I consider her to be God-loving, good hearted, purposeful and helpful. What more do I need from ‚Äúa wife material‚Äù?

            <p>
              I get a DM from someone I don‚Äôt know..nor followed. I saw we had a mutual friend, someone at my church. The DM read ‚Äúhi hi‚Äù, and he goes on to comment on my Instagram page and asks me questions on how I help people and therapy. Early on Tope was always so interested and supportive of my career and passion for helping my community. This middle part is a blur but he kept in touch sha. My impression of him was that he was nice, and cool to talk to. We got to know each other over a few months. Then, I went on a fast,  a serious one for unrelated reasons. Coincidentally, my church was doing a week long prayer and fasting as well. That‚Äôs when our mutual friend from my church started to talk to me about Tope. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good guy‚Äù, ‚ÄúI approve of you two talking (dating) ‚Äù. Talking (dating)?! Whooa whoa whoa who said we were taking (dating)?! He‚Äôs just a friend. One of the days of the fast, that friend  said the 5 words that changed my life forever..‚ÄùDid you pray about it‚Äù? I really started to realize I didn‚Äôt pray at all, and I counted this man out because he lived far away. I prayed, and after pretty explicitly being told by God this would be my husband. I decided to be obedient. I opened up my heart to him,  I started to really like him, we spoke every day, prayed together, fasted together, I introduced him to my parents, I met his. I traveled to Ukraine way too many times. And , now we are here. We made the decision to spend the rest of our lives together. He is literally everything I wanted in a man and more. Everyone knows I wanted my Yoruba man that loved the Lord. This one came with smarts, compassion, companionship, and a cute faceeee. I thank God for being so big that he could put us together. Can‚Äôt wait to see you all at the wedding!!!
